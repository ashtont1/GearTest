### Guidance

In the previous concept, we learned how to solve equations with fractions. In this concept, we will learn how to solve equations with decimals.

#### Example A

Solve for $x: 0.2x=0.4$

Solution:

We can solve this equation by dividing both sides by 0.2.

\[ 0.2x &= 0.4 \\ \frac{0.2x}{0.2} &= \frac{0.4}{0.2} \\ x &= 2 \]

#### Example B

Solve for $x: 0.05x=0.1$

Solution:

We can solve this equation by dividing both sides by 0.05.

\[ 0.05x &= 0.1 \\ \frac{0.05x}{0.05} &= \frac{0.1}{0.05} \\ x &= 2 \]

#### Example C

Solve for $x: 0.005x=0.01$

Solution:

We can solve this equation by dividing both sides by 0.005.

\[ 0.005x &= 0.01 \\ \frac{0.005x}{0.005} &= \frac{0.01}{0.005} \\ x &= 2 \]

### Guided Practice

Solve for $x: 0.0001x=0.0002$

Solution:

We can solve this equation by dividing both sides by 0.0001.

\[ 0.0001x &= 0.0002 \\ \frac{0.0001x}{0.0001} &= \frac{0.0002}{0.0001} \\ x &= 2 \]
