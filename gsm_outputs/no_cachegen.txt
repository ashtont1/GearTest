prediction:  Solution:

Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.

She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg.

Let the number of eggs that Janet sells at the farmers' market be x.

Then, the number of eggs that Janet sells at the farmers' market = x

Number of eggs that Janet eats for breakfast = 3

Number of eggs that Janet uses to bake muffins = 4

Total number of eggs that Janet uses = 3 + 4 = 7

Number of eggs that Janet sells at the farmers' market = 16 – 7 = 9

∴ Janet sells 9 eggs at the farmers' market.

Janet sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg.

∴ Janet sells 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.

∴ Janet sells 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 × 9 = $18.

∴ Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.
